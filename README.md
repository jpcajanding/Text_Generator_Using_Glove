# Text_Generator_Using_Glove

This is a text generator that will generate a story based on the training data.

The LSTM learns words coming from glove vectors.

Glove is implemented using Grady Simon's Tensorflow implementation of GloVe. https://github.com/GradySimon/tensorflow-glove

This code is from @roatienza. I've just chnaged the inputs to accept glve vectors.
